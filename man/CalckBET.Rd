\title{k-Nearest Neighbour Batch Effect Test}
\usage{
CalckBET(
  SerObj,
  ident,
  k0 = NULL,
  knn = NULL,
  assay = "RNA",
  layer = "scale.data",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SerObj}{A Seurat SerObj.}

\item{k0}{Neighborhood size. By default k0 = mean batch size. To prevent kBET rejection rate from saturating to 1, lower this value.}

\item{assay}{Assay used for sketching. "RNA" by default.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to kBET.}

\item{sketch.size}{Number of cells to sketch. By default sketch 1000 cells.}

\item{slot}{By default slot = "data".}
}
\value{
A list containing detailed results calculated by kBET.
}
\description{
Wrapper function of kBET for Seurat SerObjs.

\details{
General principles behind kBET:

When batch effect exists in a dataset, the dataset contains disproportional amounts of samples from each batch within neiborhoods surrounding
each point. Using Chi-squared statistics, test whether the proportion of each batch within a neighborhood is disproportional. If it's not
proportional (i.e. p < critical value), reject null hypothesis (proportional distribution).
kBET aggregates the test results computed from multiple neighborhoods, and reports a "rejection rate" as a metric for batch effect. High
rejection rate indicates strong batch effect, whereas low "rejection rate" indicates mild batch effect.
For "acceptance rate", it is simply a rescaled value of "rejection rate", computed as `acceptance rate = 1 - rejection rate`.
