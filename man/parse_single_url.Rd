from the 'Key Dates' table as well as relevant metadata such as the Funding Opportunity Number (FON),
grant title, activity code (with a fallback from the title if missing), and an indicator for early investigator
status (including checks for "early investigator", "early stage", "early-stage", or "ESI").
